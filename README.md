# Cross Platform Snake with C++ and SDL2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spajus/sdl2-snake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spajus/sdl2-snake)

There is no better way of learning than by building something. This is a clone
of classic [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)). By
doing this, I intend to learn / refresh my skills in:

- C++ (11+) and it's ecosystem
- [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/)
- Game Development
- Packaging native, cross platform applications

## Expectations

A lot of programming and especially gamedev learning resources available in the
open are lacking discipline and professionalism - no tests, inconsistent,
poorly organized code, no clue how to package releases - all the things that
you usually learn in the battlefield over a decade or so. This project will aim
to make a difference with following goals:

- Clean, efficient C++
- Code comments
- Unit tests and linters on continuous integration pipeline
- Automated scripts for building cross platform packages on VMs
- Developing without Visual Studio, Xcode or other IDE / GUI tools

## Status

This project is in it's very early stage. It is being built from scratch in the
open, with little spare time for it.


## Credits

of code may be copied from / inspired by these.
