# Helper scripts

These scripts are intended to be run from project root, as such:

- `scripts/clean.sh` - cleanup build files and executables
- `scripts/cmake.sh` - run cmake to generate makefiles
- `scripts/test.sh` - compile code and run tests
- `scripts/run.sh` - compile code and run the executable
